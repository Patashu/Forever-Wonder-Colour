* All Sokoban rules apply, except the win condition is reaching the Goal.
* One-Ways prevent movement in one direction.
* Wonder Blocks (orange), when pushed, cause history to re-simulate as though they were always in the new position at 'Depth 1'.
* (Note that unsuccessful moves are not a part of history, and thus won't be replayed, but a previously successful move may fail or do something different.)
* A Wonder Block changing position while already re-simulating history will truncate history at that move and start a deeper re-simulation (Depth 2, 3 and so on).
* Depth Doors close when the current Depth reaches their displayed number. (Negative numbers: -1 opens when the current Depth reaches 1+, and so on.)
* Stepping on a Splice Flower consumes it and set the current state as 'Turn 0', erasing prior history."
